# LSCplus

## A fast solution for improving long reads accuracy by short read alignment

# Introduction

The single molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing technology of Pacific Biosciences made it possible to acquire transcripts from end to end with its extraordinary long reads (> 10kb). This new method of transcriptome study has been applied on several remarkable projects on human or other model organisms. However, the raw data of SMRT sequencing present a relative low quality with random error rate at about 15%, which the error correction using the next generation sequencing (NGS) short reads was necessary in general. Here we report an improved tools named LSCplus, using the LSC program as a reference. LSCplus greatly reduced the running time, and provide high accuracy.
