# LSCplus
A fast solution for improving long reads accuracy by short read alignment

## Introduction

The single molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing technology of Pacific Biosciences made it possible to acquire transcripts from end to end with its extraordinary long reads (> 10kb). This new method of transcriptome study has been applied on several remarkable projects on human or other model organisms. However, the raw data of SMRT sequencing present a relative low quality with random error rate at about 15%, which the error correction using the next generation sequencing (NGS) short reads was necessary in general. Here we report an improved tools named LSCplus, using the LSC program as a reference. LSCplus greatly reduced the running time, and provide high accuracy. 

## Getting Started 
*   Check [Requirements](document.php#requirements) for running LSCplus.
*   Read the [Example](document.php#example) data.
*   [Prepare Datasets](document.php#prepare_datasets) for LSCplus.
*   Prepare [Configuration file](document.php#configuration_file) for LSCplus.
*   [Download](download.php) the latest version of LSCplus.
*   Follow the [Tutorial](document.php#tutorial) to run LSCplus.
*   Get the results.

## Note
*  LSCplus_cpp: Error Correction Step is implemented in C++;
*  LSCplus_Pyhon: Error Correction Step is implemented in Python.
